week 4 was for sure harder without being in class. It took me a decent amount of time to execute everything. it's not pretty by any means just trying to understand the content rather than make it pretty (just for right now). I integrated some stuff to make it 
a little more appealing like the changing colors within the text. im getting better at problem-solving which is good!
